This does not compile yet but this is how I was trying.

 RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=/home/joel/rtems-4.10-work/bsp-install/i386-rtems4.10/pc386/ make -f Makefile.rtems install

There are multiple areas which need to be addressed to get this to 
even compile.

+ sys/kd.h
+ sys/vt.h
+ sys/mman.h
+ /dev/mem
+ missing signals
+ uninstall is hacky and touches root :(

Some of this is in mmap_kit in the rtems-graphics-toolkit.

Help welcomed and appreciated.
