This is the RTEMS Graphics Toolkit.  

The packages jpeg-7 and tiff-3.9.2 appear to build correctly if
configured like this:

CFLAGS="-mcpu=cypress" ./configure --host=sparc-rtems4.10 --prefix=/tmp/jpg
make
make install

The CFLAGS and target should be automatically gathered from the
install Makefile information.

Both packages install programs in addition to the libraries we really
want.  We need to disable those.

NOTE: The install point (--prefix) is set so that the contents are 
      installed with the BSP and the CFLAGS are set for the BSP.

RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=XXX \
  ./doit configure build install distclean

NOTE: Build procedure subject to change. :)
